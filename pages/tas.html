                    <p>
                        <span>●</span> To apply for a commission you must be over 18 years of age, if you are a minor you agree to have the consent of a responsible adult when applying for a commission. <br>
                        <span>●</span> You can consult for a commission without compromise. <br>
                        <span>●</span> English isn't my mother language, Spanish is, so it's better for your description to be brief and clear. <br>
                        <span>●</span> I have the right to reject any order if I feel uncomfortable, violate the Terms of Service or I decide it for any reason, offering or reserving the reasons. <br>

                        <span>●</span> My Terms of Service are subject to sporadic changes.

                        <span>-›</span> Commission type; <br>
                        <span>-›</span> Character reference (Ref sheet or Ilustrative art); <br>

                        <span>●</span> I don't work with deadlines. The time to complete a commission can be between 1 week to 3 months depending on many factors, such as: <br>
                        <span>-›</span> Health; <br> 
                        <span>-›</span> Arrival order; <br>

                        <span>●</span> I will try to do everything I can to make my customers happy. <br>
                        <span>●</span> If the customer requests different versions of the order (such as colour changes on backgrounds, outfits or variations), depending on the complexity, they can be delivered free of charge. <br>
                        <span>●</span> Be reasonable about your sketch edit requests, I will only be able to edit the piece 3 times before you are either charged or denied any additional edits. Make sure to take a good look when you get the work in progress and take your time to approve it! <br>
                        <span>●</span> Large corrections after the sketch phase cost a minimum of $5 and can reach up to an indefinite amount depending on the type of commission and complexity of the correction so please be very clear on what you want done. <br>
                        <span>●</span> If I consider that the order is taking too long to be completed, the customer will receive an bonus gift as compensation. <br>

                    <p>
                        <span>●</span> Once I've received the payment, the customer cannot request a refund under any circumstances, so it is the responsibility of the client to pay a commission. <br>
                        <span>●</span> A commission will be fully refunded as long as: <br>
                        - I, the artist, decide to cancel the commission for a good reason. <br>
                        <span>●</span> A commission in process cannot be canceled, therefore it cannot be refunded. <br>
                        <span>●</span> Finished works are non-refundable. <br>
                        <span>●</span> Chargebacks filed after the commission´s completion will be invalid. <br>
